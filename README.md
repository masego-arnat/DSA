# Question 1: Restful APIs

The problem centers on developing a Restful API for effectively managing staff, their offices, and 
allocated courses within the Faculty of Computing and Informatics. These offices can 
accommodate multiple lecturers. A lecturer is characterized by essential attributes, including a 
staff number, office number, staff name, title, and a list of the courses they are teaching. 
Additionally, a course is characterized by specific details such as the course name, course code, 
and NQF (National Qualifications Framework) level.

# Question 2: Remote invocation
Your task is to design and implement a library system using gRPC that allows two types of users—
a student and a librarian—to interact with the system. The system should provide essential 
functionalities for managing books, borrowing them, and returning them. The student should be 
able to get a list of available books, borrow a book, search for a book, locate it, and return a book. 
On the other hand, a librarian should be able to add a book, update a book, remove a book, and list 
all the borrowed books.
